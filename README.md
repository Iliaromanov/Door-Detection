# Identification of open/not-open door using the ultrasonic module

Collecting our own data, we trained a neural network to predict whether a door is open or closed with 92% accuracy given 90 distance points from an ultrasonic sensor. We also converted this model into a format that allows it to be run on a microcontroller such as an ESP32 for live inference.

To see the model training and validation you can go to the model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook above.
